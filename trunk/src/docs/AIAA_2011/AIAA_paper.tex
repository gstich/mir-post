\begin{abstract}
Large-eddy simulation of an over-expanded planar nozzle is performed to elucidate the complex interaction between the incoming boundary layer, the standing shock wave and the separated shear layer downstream of the shock.  A high-order compact differencing scheme, which includes artificial diffusivities for capturing discontinuities, is used to resolve turbulent structures while introducing very limited amounts of numerical dissipation.   This numerical simulation seeks to model the experiment performed by Papamoschou et.al. \cite{Papam:09,Papam:10,Papam:06} and shed light on the underlying physics of the shock-boundary layer interaction and the Free-Shock Separation \cite{Ostlund:05} (FSS) which is present in over-expanded super-sonic nozzles.  To achieve a feasible cost for computing a solution, the Reynolds number of the simulation is approximately $1/15^{th}$ of the experimental value but the geometrical ratio of the boundary layer thickness to throat is duplicated.  Results of a coarse mesh simulation presented in this conference paper abstract compare qualitatively well with those obtained in the experiment despite limited resolution.  The LES captures the unsteady fluctuation of the shockwave as it interacts with the incoming turbulent boundary layer and the separated shear layer downstream.  Data from the simulation allow for a much more in-depth exploration of the physics and will lead to a better understanding of the unsteady shock wave behavior.

\section{Introduction}

A major consideration in the design of converging-diverging nozzles is the presence, and avoidance, of shock waves.  The unsteady and axially asymmetric shock wave which can reside in supersonic nozzles, imparts large ``side loads'' on the nozzle during engine start-up or under certain over-expanded conditions.  Although the occurrence of this phenomenon can be approximated at some level, there is still a great deal which is not understood due to inherit complexities of the shock-boundary layer interaction.  Conversely, the presence of shock waves inside a nozzle has recently been shown in experiments \cite{Papam:10} to enhance the downstream mixing of the nozzle jet.  Such an outcome might be desirable for engineering applications involving combustion related flows. 


The shock wave boundary layer separation in the nozzle has been classified into two different classes.  The first, restricted shock separation (RSS), is typical of nozzles which contain a small internal shock (such as in thrust optimised nozzles) and which are over expanded.  In this interaction, the flow separates then reattaches forming a separation bubble and is analogous to several other cononical shock boundary layer interactions which have been investigated\cite{Dussauge:09,Bookey:05}.  The second, free shock separation (FSS), is common in ideally contoured nozzles and is unique in the sense that the separated boundary layer fails to reattach downstream.  Rather there is a sub-sonic shear layer which persists down the length of the nozzle.  The coupling between the downstream separation region and the shock location is more complex for FSS than RSS and as a result is less understood\cite{Ostlund:05}.  Furthermore, the ``side loads'' tend to be the largest in magnitude in the FSS regime.

Recent experiments performed by Papamoshchou et. al.\cite{Papam:09,Papam:10,Papam:06} of a simple two-dimensional extruded nozzle at Reynolds number based on nozzle height $(3-6)\times10^5$ have elucidated further the unsteady nature of the FSS.  Interesting flow features such as an asymmetric lambda-shock structure in the nozzle and largely enhanced mixing in the downstream jet of over-expanded nozzles have been observed.  These experiments quantify the shock's unsteady motion and find that there is broad-band range of frequencies present.  The higher frequencies are independent of the shock strength/location and are governed by the incoming turbulent boundary layer.  The lower frequencies, however, depend greatly on the shock strength and the shock location becomes much more unstable with increasing shock strength.  The experimental data show a very intuitive correlation between the shock location and total fluctuation downstream of the shock.  As the shock moves up/down stream, the strength of the shock will vary, thus altering the total pressure loss in the flow.  However, time resolved measurements of the turbulent boundary layer and the separated shear layer downstream are not present and therefore, it is impossible to establish correlations between them and the shock motion. To date and to our knowledge, the only simulation performed which models this experiment has been Xiao et al \cite{Xiao:07}, which constituted a steady 2d Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solution.  The study had agreeable results with the mean statistics and overall behavior of the experimental setup.  However, as is the nature of steady RANS, unsteady phenomenon are not captured and we can say no more about the unsteady coupling between boundary layer, shock location and downstream shear layer.

Recently, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has had excellent success in providing results which capture the unsteady flow physics of shock wave boundary layer interactions.\cite{Morgan:10b,Kawai:10aiaa,Touber:09,Pirozzoli:09}  Reasonable comparison to experiments at ever increasing Reynolds numbers are proving LES to be a valuable tool for engineering design and fundamental scientific research.  We have leveraged this technique to generate a rich data set which can be interrogated at a higher level of sophistication then experimental data can afford.  We provide a brief summary of the methodology for the LES we are conducting and show results of a coarse, medium and fine mesh calculations which show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental data.


\section{LES Methodology}

\subsection{Governing Equations}

The compressible Navier-Stokes  equations can be written as:

\begin{equation}
  \pd{\rho}{t} + \divg \pth{ \rho\bgk{u} }  = 0 ,
  \label{eq:mass}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \pd{\rho\bgk{u}}{t} + \divg \pth{ \rho\bgk{u}\bgk{u} + \ten{\delta} P - \ten{\tau} } = \rho\bgk{g} ,
  \label{eq:mom}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \pd{E}{t} + \divg \pth{ \bgk{u}\pth{E+p} - \bgk{u}\cdot\ten{\tau} + \vec{q}  }  = \rho\bgk{u}\cdot\bgk{g}
  \label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}


where we have,


\begin{align}
	\ten{\tau} &= 2 \mu \ten{S} +(\beta-\frac{2}{3}\mu) \pth{\divg\bgk{u}}  \ten{\delta}, \\
	\ten{S} &= \frac{1}{2} \pth{  \grad \bgk{u} + \pth{ \grad \bgk{u}}^T }  ,\\
        \vec{q} &= - \kappa \grad T, \\
	E &=  \frac{p}{\gamma-1} + \frac{1}{2}\rho \bgk{u}\cdot\bgk{u}, \\
	T &= \frac{p}{\rho R}
\end{align}

Equations~\ref{eq:mass}-\ref{eq:energy} are numerically solved in conservation form on a generalized curvilinear grid.  Values are computed with dimensional units and air ($\gamma=1.4$) is used as the working fluid.

\subsection{Numerical Methods}


All first derivatives comprising the gradient and divergence operators in the governing equations are computed using a 10th-order compact scheme \cite{Lele:92}.  This scheme has high wave-number resolution which is desirable in the boundary and shear layers.  High-wave number biased artificial diffusivities \cite{Kawai:10,Cook:07,CookCabot:05} are used to smooth out sharp discontinuities in the flow and act as the sub-grid scale model.  These diffusivities are modified slightly to alleviate the harsh numerical stiffness incurred in the high aspect-ratio grid near the viscous boundary layer.

The equations are advanced in time using a 5-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme\cite{Kennedy:00} chosen for its broad stability properties in both convective and diffusive terms.  At the completion of every sub-iteration, an 8th-order filter is applied to the conserved variables to remove the top $1/10^{th}$ of wave numbers as sharply as possible.  The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability limit is near unity for the entirety of the calculation.

\subsection{Mesh}

The computational mesh is generated by mapping a single structured mesh to the boundary on the planar nozzle.  The same mesh then diverges and coarsens to form a background mesh which models the far-field conditions of the experiment.  The radius of the corner where the background mesh meets the nozzle mesh is larger then in the experiment for our coarse mesh simulations.  However, for the planned fine mesh simulation, this radius will be appreciable smaller and approaching the turbulent boundary layer length scale, $\delta$.  The converging portion of the nozzle is also modeled and is discussed in the following section.  The coarse mesh calculation, whose results are briefly examined below, attempts to maintain the same ratio of nozzle throat height to boundary layer thickness as the experiment, that is $\delta/H_t$, but exceeds the observed experimental ratio by a factor of 2.  The medium and fine mesh calculations will ensure this ratio is identical to the observed experimental value.   Thus, large scale features of the experiment such as shock location and separation point are less effected by our modeled boundary layer.  For the given resolution requirements given in table~\ref{tbl:mesh}, we use a nozzle height Reynolds number of $2.5\times 10^4$.  Table~\ref{tbl:mesh} shows parameters of the completed coarse mesh and the anticipated medium and fine mesh simulations which define the wall spacing in viscous units and the overall grid size.

\end{table}


\subsection{Boundary Conditions}

The far field employs a non-reflecting characteristic boundary condition\cite{Poinsot:92} with a ``buffer'' region applied at the last few grid point which smooths out gradients and enforces the ambient conditions.  The nozzle walls are viscous (no slip) and adiabatic, e.g. $\vec{u}_w=0$ and $\vec{q}_w\cdot\vec{n}_w = 0$.  The span-wise direction is periodic, which is an approximation to the experimental geometry which has side walls.  It is computationally infeasible (for the present LES) to resolve the boundary layer of the entire converging section.  Therefore, the computational domain begins at the throat of the nozzle and we use the method of recycling-rescaling\cite{Lund:98} to continuously feed the simulation an accurately evolving turbulent boundary layer.  The mean inlet variables $\vec{u}_i$, $p$ and $\rho$ are given by the quasi-1d approximation.  Figure~\ref{fig:info_3d} shows the inflow and nozzle portion of the domain and depicts the recycling-rescaling section.

\section{Preliminary Results}

Preliminary results from the coarse mesh simulation are presented here.  The computation ran on 256 processors for 2 days which was long enough to wash out initial transients, develop the boundary layer and capture the low frequency oscillations of the shock location.  The coarse calculation attempts to match the particular experimental configuration from Papamoschou et.al.\cite{Papam:09} with a given nozzle pressure ratio ($NPR$) of 1.77 and an area ratio ($A_e/A_t$) of 1.4.  Figure~\ref{fig:info_3d} shows the main features of the over-expanded nozzle experiment.  A normal shock wave is set up inside the nozzle and forces the turbulent boundary layer to separate.  The flow does not reattach and there is a large shear layer downstream as the flow exits into the ambient conditions outside the nozzle.

\subsection{Incoming Turbulent Boundary Layer}

We present here statistics from the incoming turbulent boundary layer.  In this wall resolved LES, viscous length scales near the wall are explicitly modeled with varying degrees of resolution.  These measures are given in Table~\ref{} for the different resolution cases.  Mean velocity profiles in Figure~\ref{fig:BL_prof} for the medium and fine case are nearly identical.  The rms profiles are less converged.

The boundary layer statistics have converged.... see.

\subsection{Shock Location}
Figure~\ref{fig:schl} shows a comparison between a Schlieren photograph taken from the experiment to results taken from the coarse mesh calculation.  Contours of the density gradient magnitude ($||\nabla\rho|| $) show that the coarse mesh calculation is in good qualitative agreement with the experiment.  The shock location, (which was experimentally reported to oscillate left and right by a distance of +/- $\delta_N$ ) agrees quite well with the experiment.  Furthermore the secondary shocks or the ``aftershocks'' observed in the experiments are captured.  From the experimental Schlieren image, one can clearly observe that there are scales of motion present in the separated shear layer which are not resolved in the coarse mesh calculation, and hence the requirement for subsequent and refined simulations.

 	\label{fig:schl}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Flow asymmetries}
The experimentalists also observed large asymmetries in the shock structure and in the separated shear layer.  Once a preferred side was selected by the flow it was maintained through the duration of the experiment.  This preferred side varied from run to run with a uniformly random distribution.  Again the coarse mesh calculation exhibited identical behavior, selecting a preferred side and maintaining that side for the duration of the simulation.  Both the lambda shock structure and the asymmetric shear layer from the calculation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:asym}.  We can also observe a rapid change in the turbulent structure of the flow near the wall as the flow passes through the shock wave in Figure~\ref{fig:asymBL}.  The distinct differences in the top and bottom boundary layers illustrate clearly the shock asymmetry present in the flow.

 	\label{fig:asymBL}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Outlook for subsequent LES calculations}
The preliminary coarse mesh calculations show surprisingly good results despite the poorly resolved turbulent boundary layer.  It is expected that the medium and fine meshes will produce data which is much richer and complete in the sense that more scales of motion are resolved.  These data sets will be used to compute more quantitative statistics which will be used to compare with the experiment and to advance the understanding of this problem and its complex, underlying physics.  We also plan to conduct a parametric variation with the nozzle pressure ratio to explore the flow regimes observed in the experiments.
